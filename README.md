# Competitive-Tic-taxs-toe

This is a simple tic tac toe game I made with C++, however, you can take the spot of another player through a competition.
Each player rolls a die, and if the offensive player's die is higher, they get the spot, otherwise they loose their turn. I
am going to add actual graphics later on, but right now it's in the form of ASCII/text.
